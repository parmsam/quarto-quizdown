A Quarto filter extension for writing short quizzes with a markdown-like syntax. It is based on the quizdown-js library and the hugo-quiz extension originally developed by [bonartm](https://github.com/bonartm):

- [https://github.com/bonartm/hugo-quiz/](https://github.com/bonartm/hugo-quiz/ )

::: {.callout-note}
Note that it's a filter and not a shortcode as it was in hugo-quiz b/c [Quarto doesn't seem to export content](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/shortcodes.html) between opening and closing shortcode tags [like Hugo does](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/). Maybe I'll figure out a way to do that in the future, but for now, this is a filter that lets you write quizdown instances within quizdown code blocks indicated using `{quizdown}` or `quizdown`.
